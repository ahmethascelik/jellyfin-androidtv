# Jellyfin Android TV - Custom Builds with Online Subtitle Support

This repository provides custom builds of the Jellyfin Android TV app with additional features that were not merged into the official repository. My primary focus is enhancing the subtitle experience by integrating online subtitle providers and adding better synchronization options.

## Features

### 1. **Client-Side Support for Online Subtitles**
- Added support for fetching subtitles from:
  - **OpenSubtitles.com**
  - **SUBDL**
- Users can now download and use subtitles from these services directly within the app.

### 2. **Subtitle Delay Adjustment**
- Implemented a **subtitle delay feature** to allow fine-tuning the timing of external subtitles.
- Users can manually adjust subtitle synchronization to match the audio.

### 3. **Enhanced Subtitle Management**
- Improved UI for selecting and managing external subtitles.
- Faster loading and better error handling when fetching subtitles.

## Why Was This Not Merged into Official Jellyfin?
The original Pull Request ([#4502](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-androidtv/pull/4502)) was rejected due to the following reasons:
- **Implementation concerns**: The maintainers had reservations about how the online subtitle integration was implemented.
- **Project scope**: The maintainers preferred to keep online subtitle fetching outside the client app and rely on server-side solutions.
- **Code structure**: Some modifications did not align with the maintainersâ€™ preferred coding style and architecture.

## Monthly Releases
Since these features are useful for many users, I will continue maintaining them in this repository. I will provide **monthly releases** with:
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Possible new features based on community feedback

## How to Install
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/releases) page.
2. Install the APK on your Android TV device.
3. Enable external subtitle fetching in the settings.
